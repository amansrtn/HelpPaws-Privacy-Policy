We are committed to ensuring the confidentiality and security of your data. By using HelpPaws, you consent to the practices described in this policy.

Information We Collect:
HelpPaws does not collect or store any personal information about app users. We do not require any registration or login process that would involve the collection of personally identifiable information (PII). We solely focus on facilitating the reporting of injured animals to nearby NGOs.

We take appropriate measures to protect the security of your information. Although we do not store user data, we employ industry-standard security practices to safeguard the transmission of video and location data. However, please note that no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
